# Welcome to CS-1104!

In this repository, you will find:
- assignment and lecture programs, and powerpoint files (**submitted**)
- code I wrote to understand different concepts (**experimental**)
- select **exam** programs

I explored various aspects of C++, data structures and algorithms, building basic CLI programs, and other concepts that are transferrable in CS field.

# Requirements
- You should have **git** <a href="http://git-scm.com">installed</a> in order to clone the repo.

# Usage
- First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/DreamLineLove/CS-1104.git
```
- Navigate to the folder:
```
    $ cd CS-1104
```
- Navigate to the directory of the source file and then run it. For example:
```
    $ cd CS-1104/experimental/insertion_deletion/
    $ ./v1_insertion_deletion
```
- To fetch latest versions after cloning, use ```$ git pull```

# Notes
- I learned the nuances of looping over arrays.
- I also learned search algorithms like linear search and binary search.
- I learned a few sorting algorithms like bubble sort and selection sort.
- I learned how to use C-style strings in C++ (arrays of characters that are null terminated).
  - In part, I learned some useful functions from the \<cstring\> header including strcpy(), strcmp(), strcat(), and strlen().
- I also learned how to interact with the standard input and output (the command-line or terminal) using C++ functions.
  - In part, I learned getline() and various other functions to handle the stdin in a buffered stream.
  - In part, I had to use \<cstdio\> and \<iostream\>
- I learned the difference between pointers and references, pointer dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic in arrays.
- I also learned various functions from the \<cmath\> header like pow().
