# Welcome to CS-1104!

In this repository, you will find:
- programs, assignments, and powerpoints (**submitted**)
- code I wrote in my free time (**experimental**)
- select **exam** programs

I explored some basic aspects of computer science using C++, like data structures and algorithms, pointers in memory and building basic CLI programs, and gained valuable basic programming experience along the way.

# Requirements
- You should have **git** <a href="http://git-scm.com">installed</a> in order to clone the repo.

# Usage
- First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/DreamLineLove/CS-1104.git
```
- Navigate to the folder:
```
    $ cd CS-1104
```
- Navigate to the directory of the source file and then run it. For example:
```
    $ cd CS-1104/experimental/insertion_deletion/
    $ ./v1_insertion_deletion
```
- To fetch latest versions after cloning, use ```$ git pull```

# Notes
- I was introduced the concept of moving through memory places using pointers (looping over arrays).
- I implemented search algorithms like linear search and binary search.
- I implemented a few sorting algorithms like bubble sort and selection sort.
- I handled C-style strings in C++ (arrays of characters that are null terminated).
  - In part, I learned some useful functions from the \<cstring\> header including strcpy(), strcmp(), strcat(), and strlen().
- I was introduced how a string is represented in memory and what it means to manipulate it.
- I learned how to interact with the standard input and output using the standard library.
  - I was introduced the concept of streams and "buffered" streams.
  - I was introduced the nuances of std-lib functions that handle data from the standard input.
- I was introduced to references, pointers, pointer dereferencing, and basic pointer arithmetic.
- I used a wide range of functionality from the standard library, including the \<cmath\> header.
