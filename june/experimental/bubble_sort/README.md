# Requirements 
- Given an array of integers or real numbers, sort the array using bubblet sort.

# Solution
- You have to use a pointer to the array because you cannot return an array type in cpp.
- If the function parameter is defined as (type \*ArrayName), when you try to access the *ArrayName* inside the function body, it should give you the pointer to the first element in the referred array!
